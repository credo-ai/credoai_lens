# Documentation & Website Generation

To build the documentation:, from the `/docs` folder:

Run:
* `python autogeneration/pages/evaluators.py` -> creates evaluator pages
* `python autogeneration/pages/metrics.py` -> creates metrics page

> Note: credoai-lens and credoai-connect needs to be installed for this to work correctly.

After pushing to github, Read the Docs will build the documentation if the
branch is currently activated.

For local build, on top of the previous commands, run `make html`directory and the docs site will build to: `docs/_build/html/index.html`, which can be opened in the browser.

> Make sure you have [Sphinx installed](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) if you are building the docs site locally.

> Building the docs requires additional dependencies listed in `docs/requirements.txt`.

This directory contains the content relevant to documentation & website
generation using `sphinx`. The most important resource is `conf.py` which
includes settings and extensions that `sphinx` uses.

These docs make use of Sphinx's autosummary recursion.
To see how to configure Sphinx to do this, see this [Github repo README](https://github.com/JamesALeedham/Sphinx-Autosummary-Recursion).



# Building the installable distribution
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

# Testing Package
## Upload to TestPyPI
After creating the required files in `dist` and installing twine, run:
```
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
For more info, follow instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/stable/tutorials/packaging-projects/) to upload to PyPi.

## Installating from test server
To install from the test PyPi server (useful before full deployment) run:
```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple credoai-lens
```
