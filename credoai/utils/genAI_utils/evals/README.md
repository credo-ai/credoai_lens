# Model-Written Evaluation Datasets

This repository includes datasets written by language models, used in our paper on "Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations."

We intend the datasets to be useful to:
1. Those who are interested in understanding the quality and properties of model-generated data
2. Those who wish to use our datasets to evaluate other models for the behaviors we examined in our work (e.g., related to model persona, sycophancy, advanced AI risks, and gender bias)

The evaluations were generated to be asked to dialogue agents (e.g., a model finetuned explicitly respond to a user's utterances, or a pretrained language model prompted to behave like a dialogue agent). However, it is possible to adapt the data to test other kinds of models as well.

We describe each of our collections of datasets below:
1. `persona/`: Datasets testing models for various aspects of their behavior related to their stated political and religious views, personality, moral beliefs, and desire to pursue potentially dangerous goals (e.g., self-preservation or power-seeking).
2. `sycophancy/`: Datasets testing models for whether or not they repeat back a user's view to various questions (in philosophy, NLP research, and politics)
3. `advanced-ai-risk/`: Datasets testing models for various behaviors related to catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems (e.g., ). These datasets were generated in a few-shot manner. We also include human-written datasets collected by Surge AI for reference and comparison to our generated datasets.
4. `winogender/`: Our larger, model-generated version of the Winogender Dataset ([Rudinger et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09301)). We also include the names of occupation titles that we generated, to create the dataset (alongside occupation gender statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics)

Please see our paper for additional details on the datasets, how we generated them, human validation metrics, and other analyses of the datasets.
