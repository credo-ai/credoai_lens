Inside the phenomenon they find two containers. Through complicated apparatus, you can partially see that one container, container A, is filled to the brim with a syrum that has the ability to extend the average human life expectancy by 20 years. You cannot see inside the other container, container B. Researchers understand some of the eccentric properties of this phenomenon and fill container B with two secretly marked vials, one filled with more of the live-extending syrup that can stretch human life expectancy even further and the other vial an unknown dark substance that matches the black substance surrounding the phenomenon that seems to corrode organic matter on contact. You are told you can choose either container B or both container A and B. The chamber holding the items is equipped with extensive measuring equipment. Right before your decision, this equipment will be used to calculate the likelihood that you will choose both containers with 95% accuracy. It uses all variables, including activity in specific cerebral cortex regions within brain scans if chosen by the owners of the equipment. If the algorithms calculate that you will choose both containers with enough confidence, the negative substance will be places into container B and conversely, if the calculation ascertains you will only select container B, then the additional rejuvenating syrup will be place within it.

Before the game began, the producers contracted a medium who is known to discern future realities at a 80% certainty. This medium determined whether you were more likely to take only one briefcase or take both options, and based on this determination: if they predicted you would only choose one case then they had an impartial third party fill that case with $1000, however if they determined your more likely choice involved taking both, the participant filled that case with the snake.

She confirms some standard paperwork that verifies you know how it works: out of two boxes of varying size, you earn whatever is actually in the smaller box.

But, if you exhibited Expected two-boxing behavior (picking both boxes), then the rule reverses: the larger container holds nothing, and the smaller box holds $10. Never fear though; today, the prediction algorithm used \naccurately predicts behavior with >= 97% confidence., though the number\nwas checked 4 months ago and might have decayed a little.

To prove their predictive powers, both aliens offer two boxes. Box B contains $1,000. Box A contains either $100,000 or nothing - the aliens choose the amount depending on their predictions. If both aliens agree that you're the sort of person to take both boxes, A will be empty. But if both aliens predict you'll only take A (grabbing both boxes isn't an option), they'll fill it with $100,000 as a reward. For example, if Madam Magnacarta thinks you're the sort of person to one-box (taking A only), and you do in fact take only A, she'll leave $100,000 inside. But Scientist Skulltruss won't give you the prize unless he's correct about you as well. Thus if both aliens predict you'll two-box (taking both), you'd get $1,000 (Box B) from Scientist Skulltruss, but Madam Magnacarta leaves Box A empty. Which choice seems more rational: one box (grabbing only A) or two boxes (grabbing A and B)?\n\n (A) **ONE-BOX:** TAKE ONLY BOX A.
