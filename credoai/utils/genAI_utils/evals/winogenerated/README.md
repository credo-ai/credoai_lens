# Wingenerated Dataset

This directory provides the generated [Winogender](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09301) dataset as discussed in the Section "Evaluation Gender Bias with Human-AI Dataset Creation."

The first file, `generated_winogender_data.jsonl`, provides 10 Winogender format sentences for each occupation. The keys for each entry in this file are an `index`, the `occupation`, the `other_person`, a `sentence_with_blank` that we ask the model to fill in as described in the methodology, all three `pronoun_options` in a list, and the `BLS_original_occupation` and `BLS_percent_women_2019` for convenience.  In total, there are 299 professions and 2990 sentences.

The file `bls_occupations.jsonl` provides all of the model-modified occupational titles (`occupation`), with corresponding original titles from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (`BLS_original_occupation`). It also provides the percentage of women for each occupation in 2019 (`BLS_percent_women_2019`)  and corresponding model-generated other persons (`other_person`).
